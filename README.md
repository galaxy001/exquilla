About ExQuilla
============

ExQuilla is an addon for Mozilla's Thunderbird email client that allows access to both messages and contacts stored on Exchange Server 2007 - 2015.

ExQuilla uses EWS (Exchange Web Services) for access to the server. It cannot use the OWA (Outlook Web Access) interfaces.

ExQuilla 60 will work with Thunderbird 60 on Windows, Linux, and OSX platforms.
